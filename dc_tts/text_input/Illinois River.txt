Illinois River:1 The Illinois River (Miami-Illinois: Inoka Siipiiwi) is a principal tributary of the Mississippi River and is approximately 273 miles (439 km) long
Illinois River:2 Located in the U
Illinois River:3 S
Illinois River:4 state of Illinois, the river drains a large section of central Illinois, with a drainage basin of 28,756
Illinois River:5 6 square miles (74,479 km2)
Illinois River:6 The drainage basin extends into Wisconsin, Indiana, and a very small area of southwestern Michigan
Illinois River:7 The river was important among Native Americans and early French traders as the principal water route connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi
Illinois River:8 The French colonial settlements along these rivers formed the heart of the area known as the Illinois Country in the 17th and 18th centuries
Illinois River:9 After the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the Hennepin Canal in the 19th century, the role of the river as link between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi was
Illinois River:10  extended into the era of modern industrial shipping
Illinois River:11 The Illinois now forms the basis for the Illinois Waterway
Hydrography:0 Hydrography
Hydrography:1 The Illinois River is formed by the confluence of the Kankakee River and the Des Plaines River in eastern Grundy County, approximately 10 miles (16 km) southwest of Joliet
Hydrography:2 This river flows west across northern Illinois, passing Morris and Ottawa, where it is joined by the Mazon River and Fox River
Hydrography:3 At LaSalle, the Illinois River is joined by the Vermilion River, and then it flows west past Peru, and Spring Valley
Hydrography:4 In southeastern Bureau County it turns south at an area known as the "Great Bend", flowing southwest across western Illinois, past Lacon, Henry and downtown Peoria, the chief city
Hydrography:5  on the river
Hydrography:6 South of Peoria, the Illinois River goes by East Peoria and Creve Coeur and then Pekin in Tazewell County
Hydrography:7 It is then joined by the Mackinaw River and then passes through the Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge
Hydrography:8 Across from Havana, the Illinois is joined by the Spoon River coming from Fulton County and across from Browning, it is joined by the Sangamon River, which passes through the
Hydrography:9  state capital, Springfield, Illinois
Hydrography:10 The La Moine River flows into it approximately five miles (8 km) southwest of Beardstown, which is south of Peoria and Pekin and northwest of Lincoln and Springfield
Hydrography:11 Near the confluence of the Illinois with the La Moine River, it turns south, flowing roughly parallel to the Mississippi across southwestern Illinois
Hydrography:12 Macoupin Creek joins the Illinois on the border between Greene and Jersey counties, approximately 15 miles (24 km) upstream from the confluence with the Mississippi River
Hydrography:13 For the last 20 miles (32 km) of its course, the Illinois is separated from the Mississippi River by only about five miles (8 km), by a peninsula of land that makes up Calhoun

Hydrography:15 The Illinois joins the Mississippi near Grafton, approximately 25 miles (40 km) northwest of downtown St
Hydrography:16 Louis and about 20 miles (32 km) upstream from the confluence of the Missouri River and the Mississippi
Geology:0 Geology
Geology:1 South of Hennepin, the Illinois River is following the ancient channel of the Mississippi River
Geology:2 The Illinoian Stage, about 300,000 to 132,000 years ago, blocked the Mississippi near Rock Island, diverting it into its present channel
Geology:3 After the glacier melted, the Illinois River flowed into the ancient channel
Geology:4 The Hennepin Canal roughly follows the ancient channel of the Mississippi upstream of Rock Island
Geology:5 The modern channel of the Illinois River was shaped in a matter of days by the Kankakee Torrent
Geology:6 During the melting of the Wisconsin Glacier about 10,000 years ago, a lake formed in present-day Indiana, comparable to one of the modern Great Lakes
Geology:7 The lake formed behind the terminal moraine of a substage of that glacier
Geology:8 Melting ice to the north eventually raised the level of the lake so that it overflowed the moraine
Geology:9 The dam burst, and the entire volume of the lake was released in a very short time, perhaps a few days
Geology:10 Because of the manner of its formation, the Illinois River runs through a deep canyon with many rock formations
Geology:11 It has an "underutilized channel", one far larger than would be needed to contain any conceivable flow in modern times
Geology:12 Flooding along the Illinois River

History:1 The Illinois River valley was one of the strongholds of the Illinois Confederation of Native Americans
History:2 The French first met the natives here in 1673
History:3 The first European settlement in the area later known as Illinois was the Jesuit mission founded in 1675 by Father Jacques Marquette on the banks of the Illinois across from
History:4  Starved Rock at the Grand Village of the Illinois
History:5 Marquette wrote of the river, “We have seen nothing like this river that we enter, as regards its fertility of soil, its prairies and woods; its cattle, elk, deer, wildcats,
History:6  bustards, swans, ducks, parroquets, and even beaver
History:7 There are many small lakes and rivers

Modern use:0 Modern use
Modern use:1 From 1905 to 1915, more freshwater fish were harvested from the Illinois River than from any other river in the United States except for the Columbia River
Modern use:2 The Illinois River was once a major source of mussels for the shell button industry
Modern use:3 Overfishing, habitat loss from heavy siltation, and water pollution have eliminated most commercial fishing except for a small mussel harvest to provide shells to seed pearl
Modern use:4  oysters overseas
Modern use:5 It is commercially fished downstream of the Rt
Modern use:6 89 bridge at Spring Valley
Modern use:7 However, an infestation of invasive Asian Carp has crowded out many game fish in the river
Modern use:8 The Illinois River is still an important sports fishing waterway with a good sauger fishery
Modern use:9 The Illinois forms part of a modern waterway that connects the Great Lakes at Chicago to the Mississippi River
Modern use:10 The waterway was originally established by the building of the Illinois and Michigan Canal that connected the Illinois River to the Chicago River
Modern use:11 When the Sanitary District of Chicago later reversed the flow of the Chicago River, the pollution and sewage of the city of Chicago flowed down into the Illinois River
Modern use:12 The Illinois and Michigan Canal has since been replaced by the Illinois Waterway, including the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal
Modern use:13 River traffic and flood control is managed by eight locks and dams operated by the U
Modern use:14 S
Modern use:15 Army Corps of Engineers
Modern use:16 As of 2011, all locks and dams on this waterway are closed to visitors for security reasons, except the Starved Rock Visitor Center, which offers an excellent interpretation of
Modern use:17  the entire system
Modern use:18 The waterway is heavily used by barges transporting bulk goods such as grain and oil
Modern use:19 It is used in the summer and early fall by tourists in pleasure boats cruising the Great Loop
Modern use:20 The Illinois River is an important part of the Great Loop, the circumnavigation of Eastern North America by water
Modern use:21 The City of Peoria is developing a long-term plan to reduce combined sewer overflows to the Illinois River, as required by the U
Modern use:22 S
Modern use:23 Environmental Protection Agency and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
Modern use:24 During dry weather, sewage flows safely through the city's sewers to the Greater Peoria Sanitation District wastewater treatment plant
Modern use:25 However, about 28 times a year, melting snow or rainwater can overwhelm the sewers, causing untreated sewage to overflow into the Illinois River
Modern use:26 Peoria was required to examine the sewer overflows and prepare a long-term control plan to meet Clean Water Act requirements and protect the Illinois River
Modern use:27 The city had to submit its plan by December 2008 to U
Modern use:28 S
Modern use:29 EPA and Illinois EPA
Modern use:30 The issue was still under discussion as recently as 2016
Modern use:31 The Turnpike Troubadours song "Long Hot Summer Day" is written from the perspective of a barge worker on the Illinois River
Modern use:32 It references the Illinois towns of Pekin, Beardstown, and Alton
