Bokmål:0 Bokmål
Bokmål:1 Bokmål (UK: , US: ; literally "book tongue") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk
Bokmål:2  Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway
Bokmål:3  Unlike, for instance, the Italian language, there is no nationwide standard or agreement on the pronunciation of Bokmål
Bokmål:4 
Bokmål is regulated by the governmental Norwegian Language Council
Bokmål:5  A more conservative orthographic standard, commonly known as Riksmål, is regulated by the non-governmental Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature
Bokmål:6  The written standard is a Norwegianised variety of the Danish language
Bokmål:7 
The first Bokmål orthography was officially adopted in 1907 under the name Riksmål after being under development since 1879
Bokmål:8  The architects behind the reform were Marius Nygaard and Jacob Jonathan Aars
Bokmål:9  It was an adaptation of written Danish, which was commonly used since the past union with Denmark, to the Dano-Norwegian koiné spoken by the Norwegian urban elite, especially in
Bokmål:10  the capital
Bokmål:11  When the large conservative newspaper Aftenposten adopted the 1907 orthography in 1923, Danish writing was practically out of use in Norway
Bokmål:12  The name Bokmål was officially adopted in 1929 after a proposition to call the written language Dano-Norwegian lost by a single vote in the Lagting (a chamber in the Norwegian
Bokmål:13  parliament)
Bokmål:14 The government does not regulate spoken Bokmål and recommends that normalised pronunciation should follow the phonology of the speaker's local dialect
Bokmål:15  Nevertheless, there is a spoken variety of Norwegian that, in the region of South-Eastern Norway, is commonly seen as the de facto standard for spoken Bokmål
Bokmål:16  In The Phonology of Norwegian, Gjert Kristoffersen writes that

Bokmål  is in its most common variety looked upon as reflecting formal middle-class urban speech, especially that
Bokmål:17  found in the eastern part of Southern Norway , with the capital Oslo as the obvious centre
Bokmål:18  One can therefore say that Bokmål has a spoken realisation that one might call an unofficial standard spoken Norwegian
Bokmål:19  It is in fact often referred to as Standard Østnorsk ('Standard East Norwegian')
Bokmål:20 
Standard Østnorsk (Standard East Norwegian) is the pronunciation most commonly given in dictionaries and taught to foreigners in Norwegian language classes
Bokmål:21  Standard Østnorsk as a spoken language is not used and does not have any particular prestige outside South-Eastern Norway
Bokmål:22  All spoken variations of the Norwegian language are used  in the Storting and in Norwegian national broadcasters such as NRK and TV 2, even in cases where the conventions of
Bokmål:23  Bokmål are used
Bokmål:24  The spoken variation typically reflects the region the person grew up in
Bokmål:25
