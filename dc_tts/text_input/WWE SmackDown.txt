History:7  smack down"
History:8 In March 2002, WWF implemented the "brand extension", under which Raw and SmackDown! would have separate rosters of performers that are exclusive to their respective programs and

MovetoTheCW,MyNetworkTV:5 On September 22, 2006, Friday Night SmackDown! aired its first episode on The CW
MovetoTheCW,MyNetworkTV:6 The CW declined to renew SmackDown, resulting in the series being picked up in October 2008 by MyNetworkTV—a second new network formed by Fox Entertainment Group, primarily
MovetoTheCW,MyNetworkTV:7  consisting of former UPN and The WB affiliates who were unable to join The CW
MovetoTheCW,MyNetworkTV:8 Retaining its previous Friday-night time slot, the season premiere of SmackDown on MyNetworkTV was the highest-rated program in the fledgling network's history, with 3

MovetoSyfy,USANetwork:15 In January 2015, SmackDown returned to a Thursday time slot
MovetoSyfy,USANetwork:16 The return to Thursday nights was expected to help attract a younger audience to Syfy, as well as more premium advertising dollars from marketers, who tend to spend more to

MovetoFox:0 Move to Fox
MovetoFox:1 On June 26, 2018, Fox announced a five-year agreement to air SmackDown, in a deal worth $205 million per year
MovetoFox:2 SmackDown would debut on October 4, 2019, with its first episode being the 20th Anniversary special
MovetoFox:3 The episode also marks the return of SmackDown to Friday nights and the return of WWE programming to Fox for the first time since the network aired the November 14, 1992 episode
MovetoFox:4  of Saturday Night's Main Event
MovetoFox:5 The agreement came as WWE's previous broadcast deal with USA Network to air both SmackDown and WWE Raw was set to expire, and as Fox has increasingly emphasized live sports
MovetoFox:6  programming and non-scripted entertainment in the wake of its then-upcoming sale of its in-house studios to Disney
MovetoFox:7 Fox had hoped to acquire Raw for the Fox network and SmackDown for FS1
MovetoFox:8 However, amid a competitive bidding situation, NBCUniversal focused its efforts on renewing Raw, freeing up Fox to pursue SmackDown
MovetoFox:9 In particular, Fox promised a larger amount of promotion for SmackDown during its sports programming, as well as a WWE-oriented studio show (WWE Backstage) on FS1
MovetoFox:10 Fox began an advertising campaign by Wieden+Kennedy for the move, "We're All Superstars", to coincide with the beginning of football season, revealing a new logo and the
MovetoFox:11  reinstatement of the Friday Night SmackDown title
MovetoFox:12 Friday Night SmackDown saw huge ratings increase since moving to Fox, adding an extra 1
MovetoFox:13 6 million from the week before, but also saw a 25% drop the week after to 2
MovetoFox:14 88 million viewers
MovetoFox:15 The October 25, 2019 episode was moved to FS1 due to Fox airing game 3 of the 2019 World Series
MovetoFox:16 An hour-long version of the episode aired on Fox the following Sunday afternoon
MovetoFox:17 Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, WWE announced that both SmackDown and Raw would suspend on-location broadcasts, and air from the WWE Performance Center in Orlando with no
MovetoFox:18  audience, with SmackDown doing so for the first time on March 13, 2020
MovetoFox:19 The ensuing episode also featured Triple H as a guest commentator, and an encore presentation of the Elimination Chamber match for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship from the
MovetoFox:20  titular pay-per-view the previous Sunday
Production:0 Production
Production:1 WWE taped SmackDown on Tuesday evenings to air on Thursday evenings on Syfy the same week
Production:2 However, SmackDown had aired occasional live specials on Tuesday nights (which are then replayed in its usual Thursday night timeslot)
Production:3 The show began broadcasting in HD beginning with the January 25, 2008 episode of SmackDown, where a new set (which became universal for all WWE weekly programming) debuted
Production:4 Following the first broadcast in HD, the exclamation mark used since the show's inception disappeared from all references pertaining to "SmackDown", including the official logo,
Production:5  which resembles the 2001–2008 logo, but with a darker blue scheme
Production:6 The early set included an oval-shaped TitanTron entrance and stage (dubbed the "Ovaltron") which made it stand out from the Raw Is War set with its rectangular Titantrons
Production:7 Later productions gained the ability to move the Ovaltron either to the left or to the right of the stage
Production:8 In August 2001, as part of celebrating SmackDown!'s second anniversary, the show received a new logo and set, which consisted of a fist centered above the entrance with the WWF/E
Production:9  scratch logo above it, and many glass panes along the sides strongly resembling shattered glass with two TitanTrons on each side
Production:10 From October 26, 2012 until April 4, 2014, SmackDown began using "Born 2 Run" by 7Lions as its theme song, with "This Life" by CFO$ and Cody B
Production:11 Ware serving as the secondary theme, then a swap was made, as "Born 2 Run" was used as a secondary theme, when "This Life" is used as SmackDown's main theme
Production:12 Prior to October 26, 2012, SmackDown opened with "Know Your Enemy" by Green Day while "Hangman" by Rev Theory served as the secondary theme song
Production:13 Upon SmackDown's debut on Syfy in 2010, it replaced the previous theme song "Let it Roll" by Divide the Day
Production:14 As of August 3, 2012, the show has used the modified WWE HD universal set, which debuted at Raw 1000 on July 23
Production:15 From September 21, 2012 until October 26, 2012, October 4, 2013 until November 1, 2013, October 3 and 31, 2014 and October 2 and 30, 2015, WWE worked in conjunction with Susan G
Production:16 Komen for the Cure to raise awareness for breast cancer by adorning the SmackDown set with pink ribbons and a special pink middle-rope in the ring
Production:17 SmackDown's ring ropes were usually blue from 1999–2012 (although they were black for a period between 2001 and 2002)
Production:18 They remained blue until December 2012 when they were permanently changed to white, with all WWE programming now using white ring ropes
Production:19 On August 22, 2014, SmackDown switched to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation, with a down-scaled version of the native HD feed on a 4:3 SD feed
Production:20 Like Raw (which also switched to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation four days earlier on August 18), the new WWE logo is seen on the ring's turnbuckle covers and also, on the
Production:21  lower-right hand corner of the screen
Production:22 On August 29, 2014, the Syfy network logo moved to the lower left-hand corner of the screen
Production:23 Although the graphics were re-positioned, SmackDown continued to use a variation of the graphics package that had been in use since its first HD broadcast in January 2008, until
Production:24  the show moved to Thursday nights on January 15, 2015, when an all-new graphics package (now optimized for the 16:9 format) and intro video were introduced along with a revised
Production:25  SmackDown logo
Production:26 On March 26, 2015, WWE added a small LED board to the left side of the ring on SmackDown, similar to Raw
Production:27 On the September 14, 2015 season premiere of Raw, the middle rope was colored gold
Production:28 Throughout the month of October 2015, the WWE broadcast table, entrance ramp, and ring skirts were co-branded with Susan G
Production:29 Komen for the cure of breast cancer
Production:30 Also, the middle ring rope was pink to promote the fight against breast cancer
Production:31 Following the brand split in 2016, the ropes return to its original blue color as well as debuting a new set
Production:32 The post brand extension set was almost identical to the TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs set from 2009-2013 and caused some negative feedback among online fans for re-using an old
Production:33  stage design
Production:34 A month after the new set debut, a more distinctive and elaborate stage was created for SmackDown
Production:35 The stage used was a new design with multiple LED side panels on each side with a titan-tron in a semi circle in the center
Production:36 The new set also introduced LED floor panels on the entrance ramp
Production:37 Feedback was more positive for this set design
Production:38 With the shift to Fox, both Raw and SmackDown introduced new sets during their "premiere week", and it was also stated that WWE would reinstate the use of pyrotechnics on both
Production:39  shows (after briefly suspending their use in 2017 due to budget concerns), and that both shows will now be staffed by separate writing teams
Production:40 The new set design consists of the eight circuit board-themed semi-arches with the octagonal screen in the centre along with the giant TitanTron screen on top that pays tribute to
Production:41  the original design in 1999 and the 30 LED side boards
